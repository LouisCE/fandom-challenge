# Fandom Challenge

## Project Overview

Fandom Challenge is an interactive quiz game designed to test playersâ€™ knowledge across various fandoms, including anime, movies, TV shows, and games (for now, just Avatar: The Last Airbender and Game of Thrones). The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating a fun, responsive, and accessible user experience. Players can select a category, answer randomised questions under time pressure, and receive instant feedback on their performance. The project demonstrates key front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and dynamic content rendering.
