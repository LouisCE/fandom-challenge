# Fandom Challenge

## Project Overview

Fandom Challenge is an interactive quiz game designed to test players’ knowledge across various fandoms, including anime, movies, TV shows, and games (for now, just Avatar: The Last Airbender and Game of Thrones). The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating a fun, responsive, and accessible user experience.
